##  Purpose

This journal entry consolidates what I learned from in-depth review and note-taking on key NIST cybersecurity frameworks including NIST SP 800-37 (RMF), SP 800-53 (Security Controls), SP 800-60 (System Categorization), SP 800-63 (Digital Identity), and the process for drafting System Security Plans (SSPs). This material forms the conceptual backbone of what a federal cybersecurity analyst must understand.

##  The Role of the Cybersecurity Analyst

A security analyst in a federal/NIST-regulated environment helps:
- Analyze threats and vulnerabilities
- Track implementation of safeguards (technical and procedural)
- Monitor security control effectiveness
- Support compliance efforts for FISMA, RMF, and agency-specific security needs
- Assist in documentation like SSPs, POA&Ms, and ATO packages

##  NIST SP 800-37 â€” The Risk Management Framework (RMF)

The RMF provides a 7-step process for securing federal information systems:

### **Step 0: Prepare**
- Identify stakeholders, assign roles (e.g., ISSO, AO)
- Establish risk tolerance and organizational strategy

### **Step 1: Categorize**
- Use **FIPS 199** and **SP 800-60** to assess impact levels (Low, Moderate, High)
- Base categorization on CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
- Identify if system handles **PII**, mission-critical data, etc.
- Outputs: PTA (Privacy Threshold Analysis), BIA (Business Impact Analysis)

### **Step 2: Select Controls**
- Use NIST **SP 800-53** to choose control baseline based on categorization
- Modify controls as needed (tailoring)
- Identify common controls vs system-specific
- Begin SSP draft

### **Step 3: Implement Controls**
- Apply technical, management, and operational controls
- Example: enforce password policy, configure logging, deploy antivirus
- Write **implementation statements** for SSP to describe HOW each control is met

### **Step 4: Assess Controls**
- Use third-party assessors or internal team
- Generate a Security Assessment Report (SAR)
- Identify risks, weaknesses, and residual risk

### **Step 5: Authorize System**
- Authorizing Official (AO) reviews package (SSP + SAR + POA&M)
- Issues an **ATO** (Authorization to Operate), **IATO**, or **Denial**

### **Step 6: Monitor**
- Continuously track control effectiveness
- Respond to new risks or threats
- Update documentation as system evolves

##  NIST SP 800-53 â€” Security Control Catalog

- Contains **1,000+ security controls** grouped into families:
  - AC (Access Control)
  - AU (Audit & Accountability)
  - IR (Incident Response)
  - SI (System Integrity), etc.
- Controls support technical, operational, and management layers
- Each control includes: Control Statement, Supplemental Guidance, Control Enhancements
- Controls are **tailored** to system needs

---

##  NIST SP 800-60 â€” Impact Categorization

- Maps specific types of data (e.g., financial, healthcare, PII) to their security objectives
- Tied to Step 1 of the RMF (Categorize)
- Helps determine impact values for CIA triad

---

## ðŸ’» NIST SP 800-63 â€” Digital Identity Guidelines

- Covers **authentication** and **identity proofing**
- Important for controls in the IA (Identification and Authentication) family
- Defines Assurance Levels (IAL, AAL, FAL)
  - E.g., AAL2 = MFA required
- Useful for justifying use of smartcards, CACs, tokens, etc.

---

##  Drafting the System Security Plan (SSP)

The **SSP** is a foundational document that describes how controls from 800-53 are applied to a system.

### What the SSP includes:
- System Name & Owner
- Categorization Level (Low/Mod/High)
- Description of the system and environment
- List of applicable controls (with tailoring)
- Implementation statements (how each control is satisfied)
- Diagrams, user roles, boundary descriptions

### Related Documents:
- POA&M (Plan of Actions and Milestones)
- SAR (Security Assessment Report)
- BIA / PTA / PIA

##  How It All Ties Together

- **FISMA** requires federal systems to meet security standards â†’ leads to **RMF**
- **RMF** outlines a full lifecycle â†’ leads to selecting controls from **800-53**
- **800-60** + **FIPS 199** help with data/system categorization
- **800-63** supports authentication and identity management
- Outputs like SSP, SAR, and POA&M form the **ATO package** for final approval

---

##  Takeaways

- I now understand what goes into each RMF step, and how real-world actions (like running STIGs or using Splunk) fit into that framework
- I can explain the structure and purpose of an SSP
- I recognize how different NIST docs support various tasks of an analyst or ISSO
- This foundational knowledge prepares me for deeper technical roles and compliance conversations

---

##  Next Steps

- Begin building a mock SSP from scratch based on a virtual system
- Tie STIG findings and Splunk logs into 800-53 families
- Continue RHCSA labs and map CLI work to control implementation where applicable
