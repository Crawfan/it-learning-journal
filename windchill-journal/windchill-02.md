# Journal Entry 02 - Windchill Introduction

**Date:** 2025-07-09 
**Focus Area:** Windchill Basics, PLM Concepts, CAD Terms

---

##  Overview

Today, I explored what Windchill is and how it supports **Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)**.
It's a web-based platform used to manage data across a product's full lifecycle—from design to
final disposition. It reminds me of how schools use Infinite Campus or Launchpad, except Windchill is
more robust and technical.

##  Key Concepts

- **CAD (Computer-Aided Design):** Tools like Creo Parametric used to design parts/products.
- **CAD-Agnostic:** Windchill supports multiple CAD systems—not limited to one format or vendor.
- **PLM (Product Lifecycle Management):** Organizes data from concept → manufacturing → retirement.
- **Modules in Windchill:**
  - **PDM Link:** Manages CAD files.
  - **MDM Link:** Manages manufacturing data like Bills of Materials.
  - **Project Link:** Enables collaboration with vendors/partners.

##  Metaphor

> "Think of Windchill like a high-tech digital binder system for engineers—every document, CAD file, 
and process step is filed neatly, tracked, versioned, and permission-controlled—so nothing is ever
lost or outdated."

##  Functional Highlights

- CAD Data Vaulting and Access Control
- Change & Release Management
- Document Control (Word, PDF, Excel)
- BOM and Product Structure Management
- User Interface: Drop-down filters, Search, Task tracking

## Next Steps

- Watch those videos again and take time-stamped notes
- Research how Windchill is used in **DoE**, **defense**, or **manufacturing** environments
- Look into **Creo Parametric** basics
