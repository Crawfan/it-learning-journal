#Journal Entry 02 - Dion Network+ OSI, Ports, Media


---

**Date** 2025-06-30
**Focus Area** OSI Model , Ports and Protocols, Media and Cable Types 

---

**What I Did:**
- Practice Linux terminal skills using cmdchallenge
- Watched Dion Training Network+ videos on OSI Model, ports and protocols, and media/connectors
- Took notes on copper v fiber media and connector types 
- learned how to make ethernet cables using TIA/EIA-568B wiring order 

---

**What I Learned**
- OSI Model Layers and how data flows through Bits, Frames, Packets, and Segments 
- Common port numbers: 22 (SSH) 20/21 (FTP), 80/443 (HTTP,HTTPS), 53 (DNS), 110/143 (POP3/IMAP)
- Copper cable categories:
  - CAT 5 – 100 Mbps @ 100m
  - CAT 5e – 1 Gbps @ 100m
  - CAT 6 – 10 Gbps @ 55m
  - CAT 6a – 10 Gbps @ 100m
- Fiber connectors: SC, LC, ST, MT-RJ (still need to look up the last 2 types)
- 568B cable order: orange-white, orange, green-white, blue, blue-white, green, brown-white, brown

**Reflection:**
- This was one of the most interesting parts of the course so far
- I’ve always seen people in IT pulling cables and working in server closets, but now I actually understand what they’re doing
- Learning the cable types, specs, and connector standards made the job feel more tangible 
- I especially enjoyed the fiber section — it made me realize how technical the physical layer really is 
- Going to review fiber connectors again and maybe try making a cable myself in the future
