# Journal Entry 07 - Windchill Overview

**Date:** 2025-07-08 
**Focus:** Windchill PLM System — Initial Impressions and Use Case

---

### 🛠️ What I Did
- Watched [Intro to Windchill PLM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXZ7C41m6wk)
- Took notes on the system’s capabilities and structure.

---

### 📚 What I Learned
- **Windchill** is a *Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)* platform used to manage and automate
  engineering and manufacturing workflows.
- It is **CAD-agnostic** — works with multiple CAD formats like AutoCAD, SolidWorks, etc.
- Provides a personal dashboard (homepage) for users to track tasks and access files.
- Centralizes product data, documents, version control, and change management.
- Built-in **access control** means different roles have different permissions.
- Helps teams avoid version conflicts, manage engineering change orders, and automate tasks across the
  product lifecycle.

---

### 🧠 Analogies & Connections
- Like **Launchpad or Infinite Campus** — but for engineers managing parts, tasks, and approvals.
- Similar to a shared **Google Drive** with version control, access roles, and task tracking.
- Reminds me of **BlackBoard or D2L**, but used to manage physical product development rather than
  school assignments.

### 🔜 Next Steps
- Look up: “Windchill beginner user guide” or “PTC Windchill field support documentation.”
- Research: How Windchill is used at **Savannah River Site** or in **DOE/DOD environments**.
- Check for any free simulations, trials, or tutorials on the PTC (maker of Windchill) website.
